==VisualVM development area==

This place is about [http://visualvm.java.net/ VisualVM] development stuff.

VisualVM is a visual tool integrating several commandline JDK tools and lightweight
profiling capabilities. Designed for both production and development time use, it
further enhances the capability of monitoring and performance analysis for the Java SE platform.

This tool is built on the NetBeans platform and provides a full extension API that allows
to create new monitoring plugin to address specific needs.

The goal of this respo is to give hints on how to create such plugins and if time allows
provide some that are ready to use.
